# CUDA Miner

The release packages do not ship with a CUDA miner, but you can build it yourself by following these steps:

- CUDA toolkit installation
- CUDA miner install
- Epoch node configuration

The documentation below is tested on:
- Epoch version 1.0.0-rc2
- CUDA toolkit version 9.2
- AWS p2.xlarge instance with 16GB EBS
- Ubuntu 16.04.4
- non-root user with `ALL` sudo privileges

The documentation also assumes that an `epoch` node is already installed either by [release package](installation.md) or [from source](build.md), thus it's dependencies are also installed.
Make sure the `epoch` node is stopped to speedup the installation process.

## CUDA toolkit installation

Download the official CUDA repository package and install it. A sudo user should be used:

```bash
cd ~
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-9-2-local_9.2.88-1_amd64
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-9-2-local_9.2.88-1_amd64
sudo apt-key add /var/cuda-repo-9-2-local/7fa2af80.pub
```

After the apt repository is set, install CUDA:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cuda
```

## Miner install

At this point the CUDA toolkit is installed. Next step is to build the cuckoo CUDA miner. If the node has been installed (build) from source, the same source tree can be used. Otherwise if the binary package has been used for installation, **the same version** of epoch source code must be downloaded.

Epoch source code can be downloaded by cloning the git repository:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/aeternity/epoch.git epoch && cd epoch
git checkout tags/v1.0.0-rc2
```

The documentation below assumes that the `epoch` source code resides in `~/epoch` directory.

Cuckoo CUDA build assumes CUDA compiler (`nvcc`) is install in `PATH`, however it is installed by the above steps in `/usr/local/cuda-9.2/bin` which is not in the `PATH` by default. To add CUDA compiler to the `PATH` environment variable run:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
```

Compilation of CUDA miner is done by invoking:

```bash
cd apps/aecuckoo && make cuda29
```

Finally the actual installation of the miner binary is copying it to the node corresponding path, the documentation assumes the `epoch` node is installed in `~/node` directory.

```bash
cp priv/bin/cuda29 ~/node/lib/aecuckoo-0.1.0/priv/bin
```

## Configuration

Once the CUDA miner is in place, one should change the node configuration to start using it. The `mining.cuckoo.miner` section of `~/node/epoch.yaml` should be changed to:

```yaml
mining:
    cuckoo:
        miner:
            executable: cuda29
            extra_args: ""
            edge_bits: 29
            hex_encoded_header: true
```

If you have multiple GPU cards they can be addressed using the `-d <n>` flag with the cuda-miner. So if you want to use multiple cards
for GPU mining you can add another configuration option (for example if you have two (2) GPU-cards):
```
mining:
    cuckoo:
        miner:
            instances: 2
```

*Note:* You should not have `-d` in `extra_args` if you are using the `instances` configuration option, it will be added automatically
by the node.

After updating the configuration, the node should be started (or restarted if it's already running):

```
~/node/bin/epoch start
```

### Mining efficiency

There is quite a bit of overhead starting the GPU miner, thus running single
mining attempts is not the best option. Therefore there is the configuration
option `repeats: N` which will make multiple mining attempts (with different
nonces) in one miner context. However, this option has to be used with CAUTION,
the total run-time of the miner should preferrably not exceed 5 seconds. The
reason being that with the short block interval of BitCoin NG micro blocks (3
seconds) - we risk mining on old blocks otherwise. (And thereby missing out on
the reward collected from the transaction fees in the micro blocks.)

To fine tune the parameter, you should try running the miner in a shell
```
$ time ~/node/lib/aecuckoo-0.1.0/priv/bin/cuda29 -r 5
...
real 0m4.634s
user ...
sys  ...
```
Here it took 4.6s, which is rather close to 5s, so maybe `4` is the best value
for this node.

Repeats are configured like this:
```yaml
mining:
    cuckoo:
        miner:
            executable: cuda29
            repeats: 4
            extra_args: ""
            edge_bits: 29
            hex_encoded_header: true
```

**Don't be tempted to use `-r` as `extra_args`** the `epoch` node will **not**
handle nonces correctly in this case.

### Multiple GPU devices

The address of a GPU device used by the miner can be set with `-d` argument, for example to set device with address 0:

```yaml
mining:
    cuckoo:
        miner:
            executable: cuda29
            extra_args: "-d 0"
            edge_bits: 29
            hex_encoded_header: true
```

The address of the device can be obtained by running `nvidia-smi`
